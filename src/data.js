    info: 'Ready Region Southeastern identifies high quality child care centers and family day homes to provide publicly funded services in private settings that meet the needs and preferences of families.<br>Quality early learning experiences are essential for preparing children to succeed in kindergarten and beyond. This impact is life-long – research has shown that children who participate in high-quality early childhood care and education (ECCE) programs are more likely to finish college, be gainfully employed, and be healthier later in life. The Mixed Delivery program provides publicly funded ECCE services in licensed (non-faith-based), private ECCE settings for eligible children. It funds full-day, year-round ECCE services for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers, meeting growing demand for publicly funded ECCE at private sites that meet the varied needs and preferences of families.<br>Ready Regions is working to “coordinate enrollment” across publicly funded ECCE programs in the region, such as Child Care Centers and Family Child Care Homes, including those participating in VECF’s Mixed Delivery program, Head Start, and Virginia Preschool Initiative. By building a coordinated enrollment system we strive to:<br><ul><li>Help parents easily learn where there are available spots for their children, what they qualify for, and information such as cost, hours, and location.</li><li>Help ECCE providers keep enrollment numbers high, communicate when they have spots available, and be able to cover the true costs of quality services.</li></ul><p>To learn more about some of our local pre-school opportunities, go to www.ReadySetRegisterHR.org</p><p>For additional information, email Heather Eberle, Coordinated Enrollment Assistant, at EberleHM@evms.edu.</p>',
